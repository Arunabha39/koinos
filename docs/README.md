### Installation

Koinos documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

To install MkDocs to run Koinos docs, run the following command:

```
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

You can run a local version of the site using the `mkdocs` tooling:

```
mkdocs serve
```

This will serve a local version of the site to `http://localhost:8000/`. Changes you make to the site will be automatically reflected here allowing for instant feedback.
